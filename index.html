        <h3>Never Imagined I Would Leave Congress": Ex Andhra Chief Minister Joins BJP</h3>
        <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-04/08htur28_andhra-leader-kiran-kumar-reddy-joins-bjppti-_625x300_07_April_23.jpg">
        <p>New Delhi: Former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy joined the BJP on Friday, becoming the second ex-Congress leader from South India to switch sides in as many days, after Anil Antony, the son of Congress veteran from Kerala, AK Antony.
            Mr Reddy, who served as the last Chief Minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh before the formation of Telangana state in 2014, resigned from the Congress in March 2023 over differences with the party leadership.
            
            Mr Reddy's decision to join the BJP comes ahead of the assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh next year, where the ruling YSR Congress and the main opposition Telugu Desam Party are locked in a bitter contest. The move could potentially tip the scales in favour of the BJP, which is hoping to make inroads in the state.<br>
            
            The 62-year-old politician had resigned from the Congress once before in 2014, after the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, and formed his party, 'Jai Samaikyandhra'. However, he failed to make an electoral impact in the 2014 polls. He later rejoined the Congress in 2018 but remained inactive in politics for a long time.<br>
            
            Mr Reddy, who hails from the Rayalaseema region, is expected to strengthen the BJP's presence in the area where he has considerable influence. He could also be projected as a potential chief ministerial candidate by the BJP, which is attempting to emerge as a third alternative in the state.<br></p>

                 <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-04/j1k7cj58_salman_625x300_07_April_23.jpg">  
                 <p>Shah Rukh Khan's Pathaan infused a new lease of life into the pandemic-stricken Hindi industry which saw back-to-back flops from big names last year. While films featuring South stars minted a whopping amount of money at the box office, Hindi films fell flat on their faces. Salman was asked about this box-office failure of Hindi movies.
                    Expressing his ideas behind this failure, Bhaijaan said in his style, "I have been saying this for a long time. Hindi films are not working. Ab galat picture banaoge, toh kaise chalega? I have met some new directors and producers who appear to be very 'cool'. They think Hindustan is from Andheri to Colaba. This is not Hindustan. It starts from the east of the railway stations."
                    
                    Salman also added that, "Jab koi picture banata hai, sabhi sochte hain koi 'Mughal-E-Azam' bana raha hai, aur 'Hum Aapke Hain Koun' bana raha hai, par hota nehi hai...</p> 
                 <h3>CBSE Revamps Assessment Scheme For Class 10 And 12 Board Exams</h3>
                 <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-03/1lbvjrv8_exam-generic-_625x300_15_March_23.jpg">  
                 <p>The CBSE has revamped its assessment scheme for class 10 and 12 board exams to be conducted in 2024 by introducing more Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and reducing the weightage for questions requiring short or long answers, according to officials.
                    The move is aimed at progressively aligning assessment with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 recommendations, they said.
                    
                    The change, however, might be limited to 2023-24 academic session only as the board exams are likely to be reformed next year with the introduction of new National Curriculum Framework (NCF).
                    
                    "The National Education Policy, 2020, has affirmed the need to move from rote learning to learning more focused on developing the creative and critical thinking capacities of students to meet the challenges of the 21st century proactively. The board is initiating changes in the examination and assessment practices for the academic session 2023-24 to align assessment to Competency Focused Education," said Joseph Emanuel, Director, CBSE (Academics). </p>

                 <p>Since it started sending data and pictures last year, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the most powerful space observatory ever built, has been sending an endless supply of information. Now, it has found the four most distant galaxies ever seen, one of which formed only 320 million years after the Big Bang, when the cosmos was still in its infancy.
                    By the time light from the most distant galaxies reaches Earth, it has been stretched by the expansion of the universe and shifted to the infrared region of the light spectrum.
                    
                    The Webb telescope's NIRCam instrument has an unprecedented ability to detect this infrared light, allowing it to quickly spot a range of never-before-seen galaxies, some of which could reshape astronomers' understanding of the early universe.</p>

                 <p>A group of passengers thrashed two commuters after they blocked the door of a local train at the busy Diva station in Thane district which comes under the Mumbai suburban network, officials said on Thursday.

                    <h3>Congress's Response to Ally Sharad Pawar's Comment On Adani-Hindenburg</h3>
                    <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-03/2o4glp38_rahul-gandhi_625x300_26_March_23.jpg">
                    <p>The Congress today distanced itself from its Maharashtra ally Sharad Pawar's comment that US short-seller Hindenburg Research's report on the Adani Group seemed to be a "targetted" attack.
                     Mr Pawar, the chief of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), in an interview with NDTV today, strongly backed the Adani Group and slammed the narrative around Hindenburg's report on the conglomerate.
                     
                     The Congress, however, in a statement kept Mr Pawar's comment at an arm's length and asserted that the Adani Group matter allegedly "linked" to Prime Minister Narendra Modi is "real and very serious".
                     
                     The Congress is among a large group of opposition parties that has been seeking a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) investigation into the Adani-Hindenburg row, a matter that had stalled parliament sessions.
                     
                     "The NCP may have its view but 19 like-minded parties are convinced that the PM-linked Adani Group issue is real and very serious," Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said in a statement today after Mr Pawar's interview with NDTV.
                     
                     "But all 20 like-minded opposition parties, including the NCP, are united and will be together in saving the Constitution and our democracy from the BJP's assaults and in defeating the BJP's divisive and destructive political, social and economic agenda," Mr Ramesh said.
                     
                     In the statement, the Congress spokesperson excluded Mr Pawar's party from the list of "19 like-minded parties" that want a JPC probe into the Adani-Hindenburg row, but included the NCP in the list of parties - "20 like-minded parties" - that will continue to fight the BJP in the national level.
                     
                     In the interview, Mr Pawar candidly said he did not share the views of his Maharashtra ally on its single-minded demand for a JPC investigation into the Hindenburg report.</p>
                    <h3>My Assessment Of Congress's Chance In Karnataka...": Sharad Pawar To NDTV</h3>
                    <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-09/2h2f2vco_sharad-pawar_625x300_21_September_22.jpg?downsize=277:170">
                    <p>The Congress has a good chance of winning the Karnataka assembly election next month, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar told NDTV today.
                     The BJP is currently in power in Karnataka and is looking to win another term in the same state where it came to power for the first time in the country's southern region in 2008.
                     
                     Mr Pawar said the Karnataka election can't be seen from the perspective of the national election to be held next year, although the BJP tends to connect national with state issues in its campaigns.
                     
                     "My assessment (of Karnataka election) is that there are two types of elections - a national election for the central government and an election for the states. My personal assessment, and you may not agree, is that the state elections are a different game," Mr Pawar told NDTV.
                     
                     "Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh aren't BJP governments. There is an election in Karnataka and my assessment is the Congress will win," said Mr Pawar, whose NCP is an ally of the Congress in Maharashtra.
                     
                     He cited more examples of what he called the real ground situation when it comes to state elections, explaining how non-BJP parties have been able to win in assembly polls, though the BJP is in power in the centre.
                     
                     "In Madhya Pradesh, it was a Congress government and Kamal Nath was the Chief Minister, though MLAs broke away and the BJP formed government later... Rajasthan, Delhi, Punjab, West Bengal, many such states are non-BJP," the NCP chief said.
                     
                     About the national election next year, Mr Pawar said the opposition needs to do something together, else it will be hard to defeat the BJP. "It will be very difficult to ignore the BJP (in 2024). Nothing will work for us if we (opposition) do not do something together," he said.
                     
                     Mr Pawar himself has experience of unseating the BJP in Maharashtra and forming government with the Uddhav Thackeray's Sena faction and the Congress. Their alliance was short-lived, as Sena MLAs led by the current Chief Minister Eknath Shinde revolted and formed government with the BJP, Mr Thackeray's former ally.</p>
