         <h3>Mars' Watery Past: NASA's Curiosity Rover Makes A Stunning New Discovery</h3>
         <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-02/moqsg23o_nasa-curiosity-rover_625x300_10_February_23.jpg">
         <P>NASA's Curiosity rover, which has been exploring the Martian surface, has discovered evidence that lakes once existed in an unexpected region of the Red Planet. The US space agency announced the discovery of rippling rock patterns, indicating the presence of vast quantities of water where scientists had assumed there would be none.
            According to a NASA release, the team behind Curiosity was therefore taken aback when they found the most convincing proof of ancient lake waves yet for the expedition. A tiny lake's surface waves mixed up material at the lake's bottom billions of years ago, giving the granite rippling textures over time.
            
            "This is the best evidence of water and waves that we've seen in the entire mission," said Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity's project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.

         <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-01/3iplbbc_black-hole_625x300_28_January_23.jpg">
         <P>Most stars die with a bang, exploding in a massive supernova. However, some stars observe a different death and are consumed by the black hole. The astronomers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope have recorded a star's final moments in detail as it gets gobbled up by a black hole. They witnessed a black hole transforming a star into what appeared to be a massive doughnut before swallowing it completely.
            According to the American space agency NASA, once a star is close enough, it is severely torn apart by the black hole's gravitational pull and its gases are sloppily devoured while a powerful radiation field is exhaled.
            
            "We climbed through thousands of feet of lake deposits and never saw evidence like this-and now we found it in a place we expected to be dry."</P>

            Tidal disruption events constitute the  entire process, according to NASA. They are among the most complicated and violent events that have ever been observed in the universe. "But the wording belies the complex, raw violence of a black hole encounter. There is a balance between the black hole's gravity pulling in star stuff, and radiation blowing material out. In other words, black holes are messy eaters," the space agency added. </P>
            <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-01/7f0d9cmg_black-hole_625x300_28_January_23.jpg">
            <p>NASA stated that in a galaxy with a dormant black hole at its core, such an event only occurs a few times in 1,00,000 years. The researchers studied the final moments of the life of a star that got too close to a black hole nearly 300 million light-years away and was devoured, emitting a burst of light which includes hydrogen, carbon, etc in an event known as AT2022dsb.

               They focus on the radiation that is arriving through the accretion disc itself, though some of the radiation emitted by these events shoots away in the form of jets. The team used the Hubble Telescope to examine ultraviolet light emitted by the star, breaking it down into its constituent wavelengths to determine which had been absorbed. This enabled them to determine the types of components that were present and get information about what is taking place inside the hot chaos surrounding the black hole.</p>
         <h3>Hubble Telescope Reveals Huge Star's Explosion In Blow-By-Blow Detail</h3>
         <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-11/cvapi498_hubble-telescope_625x300_10_November_22.jpg">
         <P>About 11.5 billion years ago, a distant star roughly 530 times larger than our sun died in a cataclysmic explosion that blew its outer layers of gas into the surrounding cosmos, a supernova documented by astronomers in blow-by-blow detail.
            Researchers on Wednesday said NASA's Hubble Space Telescope managed to capture three separate images spanning a period of eight days starting just hours after the detonation - an achievement even more noteworthy considering how long ago and far away it occurred.
            
            The images were discovered in a review of Hubble observation archival data from 2010, according to astronomer Wenlei Chen, a University of Minnesota postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.
            
            They offered the first glimpse of a supernova cooling rapidly after the initial explosion in a single set of images and the first in-depth look at a supernova so early in the universe's history, when it was less than a fifth its current age.
            
            "The supernova is expanding and cooling, so its color evolves from a hot blue to a cool red," University of Minnesota astronomy professor and study co-author Patrick Kelly said.
            
            The doomed star, a type called a red supergiant, resided in a dwarf galaxy and exploded at the end of its relatively brief life span.
            
            "Red supergiants are luminous, massive and large stars, but they are much cooler than most of the other massive stars - that is why they are red," Chen said. "After a red supergiant exhausts the fusion energy in its core, a core collapse will occur and the supernova explosion will then blast away the star's outer layers - its hydrogen envelope."
            
            The first image, from about six hours after the initial blast, shows the explosion as starting relatively small and fiercely hot - about 180,000 degrees Fahrenheit (100,000 degrees Kelvin/99,725 degrees Celsius).</P>
         <h3>NASA's Perseverance Rover Unearths Surprising Facts About Jezero Crater</h3>
         <img src="https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/nasa_perseverance_rover_jezero_crater_1661509152295.jpg?downsize=950:*">
         <P>In its quest for signs of ancient microbial life on Mars, the NASA's Perseverance Rover has unearthed several fascinating pieces of information about the Red Planet. It landed on the Jezero crater in 2020 and has been since exploring the region. In its latest discovery, the rover has found that the floor of the crater, which once hosted a lake billion years ago, is made up of volcanic rocks rather than sedimentary rocks, as believed earlier. The rover started examining the floor in the spring of 2021, after which scientists studied the data. It was found that the floor was formed by two types of igneous rocks. While one type was formed deep underground from magma, the other was the result of volcanic activity on the surface.

            According to Ken Farley of Caltech, Perseverance's project scientist, the igneous rocks collected from Mars can tell when the lake was present in Jezero. “We know it was there more recently than the igneous crater floor rocks formed,” said Farley. He added that the rocks will also help answer some major questions about Mars surrounding its climate, and conditions on it.
            
            Igneous rocks are not considered ideal for preserving ancient signs of life. Sedimentary rocks are conducive to storing such signs but the age of such rocks is hard to determine. The Perseverance rover has now started drilling and collecting samples of the sedimentary rocks. These findings have been published in a paper in Science.
            
            Years ago, a rock formation filled with the mineral olivine was spotted by Mars orbiters. The formation is spread over an area of 70,000 square kilometres. Scientists have come up with various theories to explain the formation including volcanic eruptions, and meteorite impacts, among others. In a new study, researchers have found that the olivine formed underground from slowly cooling magma after which it was exposed to erosion over time.
            
            Perseverance scraped the surface of the rock exposing its composition and studied the patch. Researchers then used the rover's Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL) to determine the size of the olivine grains, which were found to be greater than expected. "This large crystal size and its uniform composition in a specific rock texture require a very slow-cooling environment. So, most likely, this magma in Jezero wasn't erupting on the surface,” said Yang Liu of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He is the author of the second study published in Science.</P>
         <h3>NASA Confirms Existence of More Than 5,000 Exoplanets Beyond Our Solar System</h3>
         <img src="https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/earth_nasa_1643283248319.jpg?downsize=950:*">
         <P>In a major milestone for astronomy, NASA has confirmed the existence of a massive 5,000 planets beyond our own solar system. Not so long ago, we only knew a handful of planets that revolved around our Sun, but the quest to know the world beyond always continued. NASA has now added a fresh batch of 65 planets outside our immediate solar family to its exoplanet archive, pushing the total beyond the 5,000 mark — after a 30-year journey of astronomical discoveries. The NASA Exoplanet Archive records discoveries that have been confirmed using multiple detection methods.

            NASA has said that these exoplanets include small, rocky worlds like Earth and “super Earths” which are larger than our own. There are also gas giants several larger than Jupiter and “mini-Neptunes.” Some of these planets orbit two stars at once and others stubbornly revolve around the collapsed remnants of dead stars.
            
            “It's not just a number,” said Jessie Christiansen, science lead for the archive and a research scientist with the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at Caltech in Pasadena. “Each one of them is a new world, a brand-new planet. I get excited about everyone because we don't know anything about them.”
            
            Mysterious Signal From Milky Way Baffles Astronomers
            Our galaxy, the Milky Way, likely holds hundreds of billions of planets. Initially, we were able to locate only those planets that surrounded our Sun. Then, in 1992, scientists began to detect strange new worlds using powerful observatories. The first of them was a type of neutron star known as a pulsar. Studying the pulses emitted by the pulsar, scientists revealed planets in orbit around it.
            
            Alexander Wolszczan, the lead author on the paper that, 30 years ago, unveiled the first planets to be confirmed outside our solar system, said at the time, “If you can find planets around a neutron star, planets have to be basically everywhere.”

         <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-11/6b76r338_james-webb-space-telescope-reveals-never-seen-before-images-of-earliest-galaxies_625x300_19_November_22.jpg">
         <P>Bright galaxies formed early on in the universe, which were previously hidden, have now been discovered by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. This discovery also includes a galaxy that may have formed just 350-million years after the Big Bang. According to scientists, they are so bright and dazzling that they appear to challenge the knowledge of how galaxies originated.
            "Once again the universe has surprised us. These early galaxies are very unusual in many ways," said Tommaso Treu of the University of California at Los Angeles, principal investigator on one of the Webb programmes, in a press release. 
            
            The space agency further said that within four days of analysis, the researchers found two bright galaxies in the GLASS-JWST images. "These galaxies existed approximately 450 and 350 million years after the Big Bang (with a redshift of approximately 10.5 and 12.5, respectively), though future spectroscopic measurements with Webb will help confirm," said the agency in a statement. </P>
         <h3>NASA's Webb Space Telescope Finds Carbon Dioxide In Exoplanet Atmosphere</h3>
         <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-07/3ih640fk_exoplanet-wasp-96b-nasa-website_625x300_13_July_22.jpg">
         <P>The months-old James Webb Space Telescope has added another major scientific discovery to its growing list: detecting for the first time signs of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of a planet outside our solar system.
            Although the exoplanet would never be able to support life as we know it, the successful discovery of CO2 gives researchers hope that similar observations could be carried out on rocky objects more hospitable to life.
            
            "My first thought: wow, we really do have a chance to detect the atmospheres of terrestrial-size planets," tweeted Natalie Batalha, a professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz and one of hundreds who worked on the Webb project.
            
            Their study of exoplanet WASP-39, a hot gas giant closely orbiting a star 700 light years away, will soon be published in the journal Nature.
            
            "For me, it opens a door for future research on super-Earths (planets larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune), or even Earth-sized planets," Pierre-Olivier Lagage, an astrophysicist with France's Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), told AFP.
            
            The detection of CO2 will also help scientists learn more about how WASP-39 formed, NASA said in a press release. The exoplanet, which orbits its star once every four Earth days, has a mass one-quarter that of Jupiter but a diameter 1.3 times bigger.</P>
         <h3>NASA James Webb Telescope Could Make Discoveries Yet to Be Imagined, Astronomers Say</h3>

         <P>The powerful James Webb Space Telescope's inaugural batch of images has opened a new chapter of cosmic exploration, but astronomers say the observatory's most consequential discoveries may well be those they have yet to even imagine.

            Distant colliding galaxies, gas-giant exoplanets and dying star systems were the first celestial subjects captured by the multibillion-dollar observatory, putting its wide range of infrared-imaging capabilities on colourful display and proving the telescope works as designed.
            
            Webb's gallery of early photos and spectrographic data, which astronomers likened to the results of mere "target practice" as they readied the telescope for operational science, also previewed several planned areas of enquiry ahead.</P>
                 <h3>NASA's James Webb Telescope Spots Four Most Distant Galaxies Ever Observed</h3>

                 <p>Since it started sending data and pictures last year, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the most powerful space observatory ever built, has been sending an endless supply of information. Now, it has found the four most distant galaxies ever seen, one of which formed only 320 million years after the Big Bang, when the cosmos was still in its infancy.
                    By the time light from the most distant galaxies reaches Earth, it has been stretched by the expansion of the universe and shifted to the infrared region of the light spectrum.
                    
                    The Webb telescope's NIRCam instrument has an unprecedented ability to detect this infrared light, allowing it to quickly spot a range of never-before-seen galaxies, some of which could reshape astronomers' understanding of the early universe.</p>

                    <p>ISRO, on Wednesday, announced a new discovery regarding the origin of volcanic rocks on the Moon. This discovery was made by a group of scientists from the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad along with experts from the US and Japan who examined lunar meteorite samples here on Earth. Two of the samples were those that were found on Earth– first in 1988 in Antarctica, and another in 1999 in South Africa's Kalahari Desert– while the third was collected by the Soviet Union’s Luna-24 mission in 1976. </p>

                    <p>The exoplanet search and study group at the Ahmedabad-based Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), has discovered a new exoplanet orbiting too close to an evolved or aging star with a mass of 1.5 times that of Sun and located 725 light years away, according to Indian Space Research Organisation.

                     This discovery was made using PRL Advanced Radial-velocity Abu-sky Search (PARAS) optical fiber-fed spectrograph, the first of its kind in India, on the 1.2 metre Telescope of PRL at its Mt. Abu Observatory, the Bengaluru-headquartered space agency said in a statement. 
                     
                     Using PARAS, which has the capability to measure mass of an exoplanet, the exoplanet's mass is found to be 70 per cent and size about 1.4 times that of the Jupiter, it said. 
                     
                     These measurements were carried out between December 2020 and March 2021. Further follow-up measurements were also obtained from TCES spectrograph from Germany in April 2021, and also independent photometric observations from the PRL's 43-cm telescope at Mt. Abu.
                     
                      The star is known as HD 82139 as per the Henry Draper catalogue and TOI 1789 as per the TESS catalogue. Hence, the planet is known as TOI 1789b or HD 82139b as per the IAU nomenclature. 
                     
                     The discovery team led by Prof. Abhijit Chakraborty, includes students and team members, and international collaborators from Europe and the US. This newly discovered star-planet system is very unique -- the planet orbits the host star in just 3.2 days, thus placing it very-very close to the star at a distance of 0.05 AU (roughly one tenth the distance between Sun and Mercury).</p>

                     <h3>ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 Finds Noble Gas on Moon, Beyond the Region Where It Was Supposed to Be</h3>
                     <img src="https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/moon_stock_unsplash_1628757347581.jpg?downsize=950:*">Abandoned Rocket Debris May Have Crashed Into Far Side of Moon; Scientists Hope to Confirm in Coming Days
                     <p>The race to unravel the complex processes occuring on the lunar surface and its environment is heating up. As several countries are trying to know more about the Moon and build a base for humans to facilitate further space exploration, ISRO said it had made an interesting discovery. The Indian space agency said its Chandrayaan-2 orbiter found an important gas in the Moon's upper atmosphere, beyond the region this gas was known to exist. ISRO said Chandrayaan's Atmospheric Composition Explorer-2 (CHACE-2) equipment has detected Argon-40 gas in the lunar exosphere, which is the outermost region of the atmosphere of a celestial body where atoms and molecules rarely collide with each other.

                        ISRO hopes the new observation will help shed light on the surroundings and exospheric species. It hopes the observation will also provide insights on the radiogenic activities in the first few meters below the lunar surface.</p>
                     <h3>Abandoned Rocket Debris May Have Crashed Into Far Side of Moon; Scientists Hope to Confirm in Coming Days</h3>
                     <img src="https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/moon_stock_unsplash_1628757347581.jpg?downsize=950:*">
                     <p>The state of a three-tonne discarded rocket part that should have crashed into the far side of the Moon by now is not known, say astronomers. Scientists had expected the rocket part to hit the lunar surface on Friday at a speed exceeding 8,800kmph, dig out a small crater, and create a plume of smoke. But there have been no such signs so far. They hope to confirm the crash in the coming days. First spotted from Earth in March 2015, the rocket part was continuously tracked since then.

                        Initially it was thought that the space junk belonged to billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX but astronomers then deemed it was Chinese, though China has denied it.</p>
                     <h3>ISRO Says Mangalyaan Threw Similar Results About Sun's Corona as NASA's Parker Probe</h3>
                     <img src="https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/solar_flare_nasa_unsplash_1639115654161.jpg?downsize=950:*">
                     <p>The Sun is a mysterious place. Its atmosphere gets much hotter the farther one goes from the Sun's blazing surface. In fact, the outermost part of the Sun (corona) burns at a temperature rising to one million degrees Celsius, while just 1,500 kilometres below, the surface simmers at 5,500 degrees Celsius. The biggest challenge in unravelling this mystery is that astronomers are unable to send probes close enough to the Sun to get a clear picture of what's going on there. To overcome this challenge, Indian scientists used the Mars Orbiter Mission, or Mangalyaan, during a celestial event that occurs once every two years. They have also claimed the results are similar to Parker Solar Probe.

                        ISRO scientists used the Mangalyaan to send radio signals to the Sun during the solar conjunction, when the Earth and Mars are on the opposite sides of the Sun. Since the corona is an ionised medium (full of plasma), it disperses an electromagnetic radio wave passing through it. And the intrinsic turbulence of the corona causes the plasma density to fluctuate. When a radio signal passes through the region, it notices the fluctuations. These radio signals, after being received by ground stations, can allow scientists to analyse the kind of turbulence that takes place inside the corona.</p>
                     <h3>Mars Exploration Runs Risk Of Being Fooled By False Fossils, Researchers Say</h3>
                     <img src="https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/Nasa_perseverance_ingenuity_selfie_1624691326332.jpg?downsize=950:*">
                     <p>Mars has now emerged as the new frontier, with most space-faring nations focussing on the exploration of the Red Planet. The idea behind exploring Mars is to find signs of life, understand its climate, and figure out natural resources. However, a new research suggests that explorers looking for ancient life on Mars could be misled by specimens that appear to be fossils. The Martian rocks may contain numerous types of non-biological deposits that look similar to the fossils likely to be found if the planet has ever supported life, it says. Researchers say these “false fossils” are detrimental to the success of Mars exploration missions.

                        The researchers, belonging to the universities of Edinburgh and Oxford, reviewed the evidence and identified dozens of processes that could have produced samples resembling lifeforms that may once have existed on Mars. These processes can create deposits such as bacterial cells and carbon-based molecules that look like close relatives of the cells of all known life.
                        
                        The astrobiologists, whose study has been published in the Journal of the Geological Society, say as signs of life can be closely mimicked by non-living processes, the origins of any fossil-like specimens found on Mars are likely to be very unclear. This calls for greater interdisciplinary research to better understand how lifelike deposits could form on the Martian surface.
                        
                        “At some stage, a Mars rover will almost certainly find something that looks a lot like a fossil. So, being able to confidently distinguish these from structures and substances made by chemical reactions is vital,” said Dr. Sean McMahon, Chancellor's Fellow in Astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh.
                        
                        Today, there are more spacecraft operating on Mars than any other planet besides Earth. NASA has landed a rover named Perseverance along with the Ingenuity helicopter on the surface of Mars, while India has sent an orbiter called Mangalyaan to the Red Planet.

                     <h3>ISRO Develops Joint Earth Observation Satellite Mission Radar With NASA</h3>
                     <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-11/kjb9uucs_isro-logo-reuters_625x300_03_November_19.jpg">
                     <p>ISRO has completed development of a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) capable of producing extremely high-resolution images for a joint earth observation satellite mission with the US space agency NASA.
                        NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) is a joint collaboration for a dual-frequency L and S-band SAR for earth observation.
                        
                        "NISAR will be the first satellite mission to use two different radar frequencies (L-band and S-band) to measure changes in our planet's surface less than a centimeter across", according to NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration).
                        
                        NASA and Bengaluru-headquartered ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) signed a partnership on September 30, 2014, to collaborate on and launch NISAR.
                        
                        The mission is targeted to launch in early 2022 from ISRO's Sriharikota spaceport in Andhra Pradesh's Nellore district, about 100 kms north of Chennai.
                        
                        NASA is providing the mission's L-band SAR, a high-rate communication subsystem for science data, GPS receivers, a solid-state recorder and payload data subsystem.
                        
                        ISRO is providing the spacecraft bus, the S-band radar, the launch vehicle and associated launch services for the mission, whose goal is to make global measurements of the causes and consequences of land surface changes using advanced radar imaging.
                        
                        The S-band SAR payload of NISAR satellite mission was flagged off by the Secretary in the Department of Space and ISRO Chairman K Sivan on March 4 through virtual mode.</p>
                     <h3>India's Next Mars Mission Likely To Be An Orbite</h3>
                     <img src="https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-12/mars-generic-pixabay-650_650x400_71514600798.jpg">
                     <p>As NASA's Perseverance rover landed on Mars in the early hours of Friday to look for signs of past life, ISRO chief K Sivan said India's next mission to the Red Planet is likely to be an orbiter.
                        He, however, did not provide an exact time frame for the mission -- Mangalyaan-2. The second mission to Mars will be undertaken only after the launch of Chandrayaan-3, he said.
                        
                        The third mission to the Moon or Chandrayaan-3, under which ISRO aims to land a rover on the satellite, has been delayed due to the coronavirus-induced pandemic and is now likely to lift off in 2022.
                        
                        Landing on Mars is "more tough", Sivan said, adding that Chandrayaan-3 will demonstrate ISRO's landing capabilities.
                        
                        After its first Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) was successful, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) called for ''Announcement of Opportunities'' on MOM-2.
                        
                        Sivan said Mangalyaan-1 is "still working good" and sending data.
                        
                        "It is now planned to have the next orbiter mission around Mars for a future launch opportunity," according to the Announcement of Opportunities.
                        
                        Sivan said the space agency had asked the scientific community for suggestions on possible experiments and it is in the process of receiving these.</p>
                     <h3>ISRO-NASA Satellite NISAR Scheduled To Be Launched By 2022</h3>

                     <p>The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) satellite is expected to be launched by 2022 as India and the US have decided to share Space Situational Awareness Information, which will catalyse efforts to create the conditions for a safe and sustainable space environment.
                        The two sides also expressed the intent to continue the India-US Space Dialogue as well as discussions on areas of potential space defense cooperation.
                        
                        A joint statement, issued after the 2+2 strategic dialogue between Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and their US counterparts Secretary of States Michael R Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark T Esper, said, "...the ministers applauded the ongoing collaboration between Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration, including on the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) satellite scheduled to be launched by 2022."
                        
                        The space agencies of the two countries had signed an agreement in 2014 to conduct the joint NISAR mission to co-develop and launch a dual-frequency synthetic aperture radar on an Earth observation satellite.
                        
                        "The ministers also looked forward to sharing Space Situational Awareness information, which will catalyse efforts to create the conditions for a safe, stable, and sustainable space environment," it said.
                        
                        The ministers welcomed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for Technical Cooperation in Earth Observation and Earth Sciences between the Ministry of Earth Sciences and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the joint statement said.</p>

                     In a series of tweets along with a picture taken by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbital (LRO), Mr Subramanian claimed that the rover had  out a few metres from the skeleton Vikram lander.</p>
                     <h3>NASA Study Finds Climate Extremes Affect Landslides in Surprising Ways</h3>                     </h3>
                     <img src="https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcFVDIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--20ff10792ed8718907cecd6ecb9544287840c0c7/Mar17-June18-MudCreek-logoless_NWcRbjH.gif?disposition=attachment">
                     <p>Climate change is driving more volatile precipitation patterns around the world – very dry stretches punctuated by storms that drop large amounts of rain or snow in a short amount of time. While wetter and drier spells may have certain effects that are easy to predict, such as on water levels in lakes and rivers, a recent study focused on California reveals that they can affect slow-moving landslides in unanticipated ways.

                        The researchers expected slow-moving landslides – where land creeps downhill just inches to feet in a year – in bone-dry Southern California to behave differently from those in rainy Northern California when exposed to heavy precipitation and drought conditions. But that wasn’t the case. The study authors found that landslides in wetter and drier regions of California showed similar sensitivity to precipitation extremes, moving on average faster and farther downhill during rainy periods compared to drought years.
                        
                        Water triggers landslides, and knowing how landslides react to record drought or extreme rainfall can help researchers better predict their future behavior, including whether any could collapse, or fail catastrophically. The big-picture goal is to develop a statewide inventory of landslide behavior that would inform a monitoring network. While slow-moving landslides don’t necessarily pose an immediate danger to people or infrastructure, over time they can damage things like roads and buildings. And in some instances, they can suddenly collapse, which is what occurred with the Mud Creek landslide near Big Sur in 2017.
                        
                        “I thought the results would be quite different between Northern and Southern California,” said Alexander Handwerger, a landslide scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and the lead author of the study, which was recently published in Geophysical Research Letters. His work up until this paper focused on landslides in Northern California, so he wasn’t sure what he’d see when he looked at drier parts of the state.</p>
