         <h3>Mars' Watery Past: NASA's Curiosity Rover Makes A Stunning New Discovery</h3>
         <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-02/moqsg23o_nasa-curiosity-rover_625x300_10_February_23.jpg">
         <P>NASA's Curiosity rover, which has been exploring the Martian surface, has discovered evidence that lakes once existed in an unexpected region of the Red Planet. The US space agency announced the discovery of rippling rock patterns, indicating the presence of vast quantities of water where scientists had assumed there would be none.
            According to a NASA release, the team behind Curiosity was therefore taken aback when they found the most convincing proof of ancient lake waves yet for the expedition. A tiny lake's surface waves mixed up material at the lake's bottom billions of years ago, giving the granite rippling textures over time.
            
            "This is the best evidence of water and waves that we've seen in the entire mission," said Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity's project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.
            
            "We climbed through thousands of feet of lake deposits and never saw evidence like this-and now we found it in a place we expected to be dry."</P>
         <h3>NASA's Hubble Telescope Discovers Black Hole Twisting A Star Into Donut Shape</h3>
         <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-01/3iplbbc_black-hole_625x300_28_January_23.jpg">
         <P>Most stars die with a bang, exploding in a massive supernova. However, some stars observe a different death and are consumed by the black hole. The astronomers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope have recorded a star's final moments in detail as it gets gobbled up by a black hole. They witnessed a black hole transforming a star into what appeared to be a massive doughnut before swallowing it completely.
            According to the American space agency NASA, once a star is close enough, it is severely torn apart by the black hole's gravitational pull and its gases are sloppily devoured while a powerful radiation field is exhaled.
            
            Tidal disruption events constitute the  entire process, according to NASA. They are among the most complicated and violent events that have ever been observed in the universe. "But the wording belies the complex, raw violence of a black hole encounter. There is a balance between the black hole's gravity pulling in star stuff, and radiation blowing material out. In other words, black holes are messy eaters," the space agency added. </P>
            <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2023-01/7f0d9cmg_black-hole_625x300_28_January_23.jpg">
            <p>NASA stated that in a galaxy with a dormant black hole at its core, such an event only occurs a few times in 1,00,000 years. The researchers studied the final moments of the life of a star that got too close to a black hole nearly 300 million light-years away and was devoured, emitting a burst of light which includes hydrogen, carbon, etc in an event known as AT2022dsb.

               They focus on the radiation that is arriving through the accretion disc itself, though some of the radiation emitted by these events shoots away in the form of jets. The team used the Hubble Telescope to examine ultraviolet light emitted by the star, breaking it down into its constituent wavelengths to determine which had been absorbed. This enabled them to determine the types of components that were present and get information about what is taking place inside the hot chaos surrounding the black hole.</p>
         <h3>Hubble Telescope Reveals Huge Star's Explosion In Blow-By-Blow Detail</h3>
         <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-11/cvapi498_hubble-telescope_625x300_10_November_22.jpg">
         <P>About 11.5 billion years ago, a distant star roughly 530 times larger than our sun died in a cataclysmic explosion that blew its outer layers of gas into the surrounding cosmos, a supernova documented by astronomers in blow-by-blow detail.
            Researchers on Wednesday said NASA's Hubble Space Telescope managed to capture three separate images spanning a period of eight days starting just hours after the detonation - an achievement even more noteworthy considering how long ago and far away it occurred.
            
            The images were discovered in a review of Hubble observation archival data from 2010, according to astronomer Wenlei Chen, a University of Minnesota postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.
            
            They offered the first glimpse of a supernova cooling rapidly after the initial explosion in a single set of images and the first in-depth look at a supernova so early in the universe's history, when it was less than a fifth its current age.
            
            "The supernova is expanding and cooling, so its color evolves from a hot blue to a cool red," University of Minnesota astronomy professor and study co-author Patrick Kelly said.
            
            The doomed star, a type called a red supergiant, resided in a dwarf galaxy and exploded at the end of its relatively brief life span.
            
            "Red supergiants are luminous, massive and large stars, but they are much cooler than most of the other massive stars - that is why they are red," Chen said. "After a red supergiant exhausts the fusion energy in its core, a core collapse will occur and the supernova explosion will then blast away the star's outer layers - its hydrogen envelope."
            
            The first image, from about six hours after the initial blast, shows the explosion as starting relatively small and fiercely hot - about 180,000 degrees Fahrenheit (100,000 degrees Kelvin/99,725 degrees Celsius).</P>
         <h3>NASA's Perseverance Rover Unearths Surprising Facts About Jezero Crater</h3>
         <img src="https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/nasa_perseverance_rover_jezero_crater_1661509152295.jpg?downsize=950:*">
         <P>In its quest for signs of ancient microbial life on Mars, the NASA's Perseverance Rover has unearthed several fascinating pieces of information about the Red Planet. It landed on the Jezero crater in 2020 and has been since exploring the region. In its latest discovery, the rover has found that the floor of the crater, which once hosted a lake billion years ago, is made up of volcanic rocks rather than sedimentary rocks, as believed earlier. The rover started examining the floor in the spring of 2021, after which scientists studied the data. It was found that the floor was formed by two types of igneous rocks. While one type was formed deep underground from magma, the other was the result of volcanic activity on the surface.

            According to Ken Farley of Caltech, Perseverance's project scientist, the igneous rocks collected from Mars can tell when the lake was present in Jezero. “We know it was there more recently than the igneous crater floor rocks formed,” said Farley. He added that the rocks will also help answer some major questions about Mars surrounding its climate, and conditions on it.
            
            Igneous rocks are not considered ideal for preserving ancient signs of life. Sedimentary rocks are conducive to storing such signs but the age of such rocks is hard to determine. The Perseverance rover has now started drilling and collecting samples of the sedimentary rocks. These findings have been published in a paper in Science.
            
            Years ago, a rock formation filled with the mineral olivine was spotted by Mars orbiters. The formation is spread over an area of 70,000 square kilometres. Scientists have come up with various theories to explain the formation including volcanic eruptions, and meteorite impacts, among others. In a new study, researchers have found that the olivine formed underground from slowly cooling magma after which it was exposed to erosion over time.
            
            Perseverance scraped the surface of the rock exposing its composition and studied the patch. Researchers then used the rover's Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL) to determine the size of the olivine grains, which were found to be greater than expected. "This large crystal size and its uniform composition in a specific rock texture require a very slow-cooling environment. So, most likely, this magma in Jezero wasn't erupting on the surface,” said Yang Liu of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He is the author of the second study published in Science.</P>
         <h3>NASA Confirms Existence of More Than 5,000 Exoplanets Beyond Our Solar System</h3>
         <img src="https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/earth_nasa_1643283248319.jpg?downsize=950:*">
         <P>In a major milestone for astronomy, NASA has confirmed the existence of a massive 5,000 planets beyond our own solar system. Not so long ago, we only knew a handful of planets that revolved around our Sun, but the quest to know the world beyond always continued. NASA has now added a fresh batch of 65 planets outside our immediate solar family to its exoplanet archive, pushing the total beyond the 5,000 mark — after a 30-year journey of astronomical discoveries. The NASA Exoplanet Archive records discoveries that have been confirmed using multiple detection methods.

            NASA has said that these exoplanets include small, rocky worlds like Earth and “super Earths” which are larger than our own. There are also gas giants several larger than Jupiter and “mini-Neptunes.” Some of these planets orbit two stars at once and others stubbornly revolve around the collapsed remnants of dead stars.
            
            “It's not just a number,” said Jessie Christiansen, science lead for the archive and a research scientist with the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at Caltech in Pasadena. “Each one of them is a new world, a brand-new planet. I get excited about everyone because we don't know anything about them.”
            
            Mysterious Signal From Milky Way Baffles Astronomers
            Our galaxy, the Milky Way, likely holds hundreds of billions of planets. Initially, we were able to locate only those planets that surrounded our Sun. Then, in 1992, scientists began to detect strange new worlds using powerful observatories. The first of them was a type of neutron star known as a pulsar. Studying the pulses emitted by the pulsar, scientists revealed planets in orbit around it.
            
            Alexander Wolszczan, the lead author on the paper that, 30 years ago, unveiled the first planets to be confirmed outside our solar system, said at the time, “If you can find planets around a neutron star, planets have to be basically everywhere.”

         <h3>James Webb Space Telescope Reveals Never Seen Before Images Of Earliest Galaxies</h3>
         <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-11/6b76r338_james-webb-space-telescope-reveals-never-seen-before-images-of-earliest-galaxies_625x300_19_November_22.jpg">
         <P>Bright galaxies formed early on in the universe, which were previously hidden, have now been discovered by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. This discovery also includes a galaxy that may have formed just 350-million years after the Big Bang. According to scientists, they are so bright and dazzling that they appear to challenge the knowledge of how galaxies originated.
            "Once again the universe has surprised us. These early galaxies are very unusual in many ways," said Tommaso Treu of the University of California at Los Angeles, principal investigator on one of the Webb programmes, in a press release. 
            
            The space agency further said that within four days of analysis, the researchers found two bright galaxies in the GLASS-JWST images. "These galaxies existed approximately 450 and 350 million years after the Big Bang (with a redshift of approximately 10.5 and 12.5, respectively), though future spectroscopic measurements with Webb will help confirm," said the agency in a statement. </P>
         <h3>NASA's Webb Space Telescope Finds Carbon Dioxide In Exoplanet Atmosphere</h3>
         <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-07/3ih640fk_exoplanet-wasp-96b-nasa-website_625x300_13_July_22.jpg">
         <P>The months-old James Webb Space Telescope has added another major scientific discovery to its growing list: detecting for the first time signs of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of a planet outside our solar system.
            Although the exoplanet would never be able to support life as we know it, the successful discovery of CO2 gives researchers hope that similar observations could be carried out on rocky objects more hospitable to life.
            
            "My first thought: wow, we really do have a chance to detect the atmospheres of terrestrial-size planets," tweeted Natalie Batalha, a professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz and one of hundreds who worked on the Webb project.
            
            Their study of exoplanet WASP-39, a hot gas giant closely orbiting a star 700 light years away, will soon be published in the journal Nature.
            
            "For me, it opens a door for future research on super-Earths (planets larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune), or even Earth-sized planets," Pierre-Olivier Lagage, an astrophysicist with France's Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), told AFP.
            
            The detection of CO2 will also help scientists learn more about how WASP-39 formed, NASA said in a press release. The exoplanet, which orbits its star once every four Earth days, has a mass one-quarter that of Jupiter but a diameter 1.3 times bigger.</P>
         <h3>NASA James Webb Telescope Could Make Discoveries Yet to Be Imagined, Astronomers Say</h3>
         <img src="https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/james_webb_reuters_main_1657780879568.jpg?downsize=950:*">
         <P>The powerful James Webb Space Telescope's inaugural batch of images has opened a new chapter of cosmic exploration, but astronomers say the observatory's most consequential discoveries may well be those they have yet to even imagine.

            Distant colliding galaxies, gas-giant exoplanets and dying star systems were the first celestial subjects captured by the multibillion-dollar observatory, putting its wide range of infrared-imaging capabilities on colourful display and proving the telescope works as designed.
            
            Webb's gallery of early photos and spectrographic data, which astronomers likened to the results of mere "target practice" as they readied the telescope for operational science, also previewed several planned areas of enquiry ahead.</P>
                 <h3>NASA's James Webb Telescope Spots Four Most Distant Galaxies Ever Observed</h3>
                 <img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2022-01/s030j1b8_james-webb-space-telescope-650_625x300_08_January_22.jpg">  
                 <p>Since it started sending data and pictures last year, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the most powerful space observatory ever built, has been sending an endless supply of information. Now, it has found the four most distant galaxies ever seen, one of which formed only 320 million years after the Big Bang, when the cosmos was still in its infancy.
                    By the time light from the most distant galaxies reaches Earth, it has been stretched by the expansion of the universe and shifted to the infrared region of the light spectrum.
                    
                    The Webb telescope's NIRCam instrument has an unprecedented ability to detect this infrared light, allowing it to quickly spot a range of never-before-seen galaxies, some of which could reshape astronomers' understanding of the early universe.</p>
